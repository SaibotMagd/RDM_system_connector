# (semi-) automatic description & ontology linking creation
- use [LLM](LLM%20backbone.md) to create descriptions for the augmented tag's [(semi-)_automatic_tag_creation](#(semi-)%20automatic%20tag%20creation)
- combine the descriptions and tag's to use a character similarity based decision system which searches for the appropriate ontology and ontology entry through multiple queries using [Ontology lookup service v4 (OLS4)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4)
